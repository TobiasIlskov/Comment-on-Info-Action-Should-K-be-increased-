As they come on-chain to re-stake, it provides a window of opportunity to also encourage them to delegate to a DRep, which strengthens Cardano's governance resilience\n\nNegative:\nThe main negative is that some single SPOs (who are committed to only operating 1 pool) may no longer be able to run their pools profitably. \n\nI see the benefit as more impactful"
